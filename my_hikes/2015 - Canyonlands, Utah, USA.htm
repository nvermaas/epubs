<P>
Hiking into Canyonlands had been on my bucket list for many years. In 2013 I revisited this impressive place after many many years, but I was not yet ready to go in. This is severe desert, which is not something I am used to. But I promised myself that next time I would hike in and camp in the Needles wilderness. I bought 'the map', asked the rangers for advice, and set the date. Fall 2015... I kept my promise and it was an amazing journey into the backcountry of Chestler Park. We had to bring enough water to survive in the desert for 3 days, about 6 liter a person on top of the usual camping gear and supplies. The terrain was sometimes hard, because we had to scamble over boulders with very these heavy packs. But it was amazing!
