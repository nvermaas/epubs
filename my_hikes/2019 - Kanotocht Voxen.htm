Midsummer in Sweden. Would it be possible to have a wilderness experience in high season in south central Sweden? Yes and no. We paddled for 4 days and had our solitude in our beautiful little camps. But it was also very busy and there was such a hunt going on for the established campsites that most people seemed to stay put instead of paddling. Not us, because we forgot to buy the required nature card and had to camp wild anyway. The weather was hot and being on the water wasn't too bad. All together, a great experience!
