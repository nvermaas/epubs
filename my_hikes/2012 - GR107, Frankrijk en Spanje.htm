<P>
We started in the last village before the Spanish border and hiked into the Pyrenees mountains. Chemin des Bomhommes, in the footsteps of the Cathares. A long grueling day brought us over the mountain pass on the France/Andorra/Spain border. And into bad weather. It was a hard trip, both physically and mentally. It was difficult to find suitable places to camp and at the end of day 5 the weather got so bad that my old trusted tent died. Our equipment was soaked and we decided to give up. But we couldn't even give up, because there was no transportation out. So we continued, the sun came out, we became happy, and all was well in our world. One of those trips with misery and joy, those are the best ones.
