<P class="intro">
What starts as a happy hiking adventure turns into a survival situation. We aimed for a wilderness area on the edge of a national park that doesn't have roads, buildings or even phone coverage. Instead, it has raindeer, wolves and bears. We reached our goal, over a slippery rocky path, into the secluded valley. And there the unthinkable happened... I slipped and broke my leg... We had practised for such an emergency scenario a week before, when we were still hiking in Saltfjallet National Park. We both stayed very calm and knew exactly what to do. First stabilizing the medical situation, then creating a safe emergency shelter where I could wait for Ingeborg to return with help. It took 10 hours to get to a hospital.
