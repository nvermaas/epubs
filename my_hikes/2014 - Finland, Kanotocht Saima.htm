A remarkable wilderness adventure, thanks to some determination and a lot of luck. We took the long road to get to Finland, through Poland and the Baltic States. When I called the Canoe Center from Talinn, Estonia, the owner told me that he had to leave for an emergency and that we would have to sort everything ourselves and leave the cash in a box. And so we did. What followed was a tremendous journey, 100 km paddling in 7 days, camping on remote uninhabited islands every night. And miraculously, the weather stayed good for the entire week. When we returned there was still nobody there, but the money was collected. So we just stored everything as we had found it and continued on our journey around the Baltic sea. The solitude, the campfires, the simple rhythm of paddling and camping. What an amazing stuff!
