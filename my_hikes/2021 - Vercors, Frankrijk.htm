<P>
An unexpected 4 day memorial hike into the Vercors Mountains. It had been 2 years since the last hike (in Lemmenjoki, Finland) due to Corona travel restrictions. I gained some years and some weight, and lost some confidence. I was standing at the foot of the mountains, looking up at the peaks and saying my farewell to Petra, my first wife and hiking partner. The high plateau looked so close, and yet almost unreachable. Until Ingeborg took the initiative and just shoved our arses up to the plateau. We hiked for 4 days, in a familiar and soothing wilderness. Healing body, mind and soul in times of sorrow. It became a memorial hike for Petra.
