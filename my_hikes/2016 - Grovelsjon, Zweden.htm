<P>
The plan was simple enough, just follow the 4 day route that I had drawn on a map. With enough supplies to last an extra day. But every day turned out different than planned. Camping in the sheltered valleys was easy, but camping on the exposed fjells in these high winds was too dangerous. But it all did not matter, we could easily adjust our plans. And altogether we spent 7 days in the backcountry.
