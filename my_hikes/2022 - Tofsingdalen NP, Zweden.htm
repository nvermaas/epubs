Return to Tofsingdalen, after I broke my leg during the first attempt in 2017. This time it was a glorious 5 day hike. We didn't manage to 'connect' our trail to our previous 2016 and 2017 trails due to the very rough terrain, but we found an even better alternative by taking a trail right into the national park. We camped at 'wind shelters' so that we could use the free wood there for campfires, which I first had to saw and hack. The fall colors were amazing, and we hardly saw anybody, except for a solitary moose hunter and a few hikers during the weekend. It was mostly dry with a little bit of rain on the first day. It was chilly, with a bit of frost during the nights. But right when we reached the deepest part of Tofsingdalen, with the most spectaclular scenery, the sun came out. This was a very, very good hike!
