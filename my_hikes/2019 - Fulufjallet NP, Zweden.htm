<P>
Return to Hike, after almost 2 years! Within visual range of where I broke my leg last time. We got stuck one night because of the rain in this 'worse summer in 50 years', but all that counted for me that I was there. Back into the wild, sleeping in my tent, drinking from the river, eating horrible food and waking up with pain in places that you didn't know you had. I loved it!
