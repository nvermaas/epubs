<P>
We stayed in this diverse wilderness world for 7 full days. Carrying everything in our backpacks, except drinking water. Water is sparse, there are a some springs but they do not always flow. It is surprising to find a remote area like this in France because it is a busy and full country. But the high plain is not very easy to reach, and staying up there for multiple days requires an efford, especially if you camp. So it feels pretty remote. There is a lot of wildlife up there, vultures, marmots, capricorn and even 2 packs of wolves. We lost track of the planning after 2 days and just wandered criss cross through the area from spring to spring, camping in the wild. No phone, no internet, no towns, no traffic and no money. Just nature and us.
