<P>
A 4 day canoeing trip with my brother Erik in Sweden. My first time in a canoe, but certainly not the last. We learned a lot. Never cross a fjord in stormy weather, don't wear hiking boots in a canoe and use bait when fishing. (count the pictures of Erik fishing, and realise that we didn't catch a single fish in 4 days)
