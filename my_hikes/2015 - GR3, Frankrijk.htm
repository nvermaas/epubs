<P>
Nowadays most of my hiking trips are in remote area's with a lot of wilderness camping, preferably in the cooler days of autumn. That used to be different, I used to make most of my hikes between towns and campsites, which has the huge advantage of fresh food, wine and the occasional shower. This was one of those hikes, to remind myself of how it compares to the wilder hikes. And oulala, I still love France!
