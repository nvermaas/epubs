<P>
This was supposed to be a 4 week trip through the southwest of Canada. But because one of the BC Ferries sunk we had to change our plans. We made a loop from Vancouver through Washington (USA) and the Canadian Rockies. We made 2 treks, a 4 day trek into Olympic Rainforest and a short overnight hike in Banff NP in the Rockies.
