<P>
This empty boreal forest has a uneasy edge. This is taiga north of the arctic circle, deadly in winter, and this far into the dark season we felt the winter approaching. Bad weather was always close, which could turn the partly dry bogs into dangerous swampland. And the wind in this open country was severe. We played it safe, walked only a few hours a day, and let ourselves be overwhelmed by the wild beauty of this place.
